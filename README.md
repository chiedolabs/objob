# Ob Job (beta)

A library of deep/recursive utilities for nested objects.

After usage in beta, objob is not efficient at all. It's useful for some small cases but overall, meh...

Many functions will be similar to the object functions in lodash but will be deep/recursive versions.

Ob Job includes the following functions and many more with every function being a deep/recursive implementation:

* clone
* equals
* expand
* filter
* flatten
* keys
* mapValues
* merge
* omit
* pick
* values
* [More...](https://rawgit.com/chiedolabs/objob/master/docs/index.html)

## Bugs

Objob is still in beta so please submit issues if you find any bugs.

## Roadmap

 * It is on the todo list to port over all of the lodash Object functions and make them recursive. So much to do, so little time.
