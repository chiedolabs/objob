# Ob Job (beta) Documentation

Ob Job is a library of deep/recursive utilities for nested objects. Many functions will be similar to the object functions in lodash but will be deep/recursive versions.

### Reserved Characters.
*Note that deep operations will not work if any of your object's keys contain <code>.</code> or <code>[]</code>. With Objob, <code>.</code> and <code>[]</code> are reserved for the flat notation of the objects.*

## Installation
	npm install objob
	
## Usage
	import ob from 'objob';

## Bugs

Ob Job is still in beta so please submit issues if you find any bugs.
