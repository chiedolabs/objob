# Ob Job (beta) Documentation

Ob Job is a library of deep/recursive utilities for nested objects. Many functions will be similar to the object functions in lodash but will be deep/recursive versions.

### Not compatible with object keys containing periods.
*Note that deep operations will not work if any of your object's keys contain periods. With Objob, periods are reserved for the flat notation of the objects.*

## Installation
	npm install objob
	
## Usage
	import ob from 'objob';

## Bugs

Ob Job is still in beta so please submit issues if you find any bugs.
